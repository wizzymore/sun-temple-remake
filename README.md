There are still a lot that could be done but currently i am satisfied.  
- Not all materials have been updated, only the ones i needed to use for screenshots
- Reflection Probes are still not perfect, there are hard lines of shadows on the ground in some parts
- Baked AO from textures are not used in the materials

Screenshots:
